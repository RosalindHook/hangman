# hangman

Challenge accepted from CFG unofficial discord. This is a mini project to practice Python, and to do the following:

***The Rules:***
- The program automatically selects a word from a list
Use a list as a basic solution
Read from a comma separated file as an advanced solution

- The program sets the players lives
Use 6 as an average for a basic solution
The user can choose Easy (10) Medium (6) Hard (4) as a difficulty setting for an advanced solution

- The user repeatedly guesses
Basic: Singular letters only
Advanced: User can provide a single letter or if the input is greater than 1 length, assume they're guessing the whole word

- If the player successfully guesses the all the letters/ the word before they run out of lives - they win! Otherwise, if they run out of lives, they lose!

- All guesses are case insensitive.

***Usage:***
- Please feel free to send pull requests and make changes - this project is open for contributions to anyone on the CFG degree who would like to practice using Github and practice their Python in a safe space.
- There are some 'TODO' options in the main hangman.py file - anyone is welcome to give these a try.
- It is initially set up as a basic hangman game with a game loop - but would like to customise this to include all the options above (e.g. basic/advanced options, and setting player lives depending on difficulty level)
- Also please do suggest any other changes you might like to do - could be adding some ASCII art, extending the csv file list of autumn words, adding a front end (absolutely NO IDEA how to do this with Python but would love to learn... GUI anyone?
- Or absolutely anything else! Do feel free to experiment away...
